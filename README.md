# maths2Clipboard

### Motivation

Entering mathematical expressions on most online platforms requires navigating a slow, clunky, and un-intuitive interface. It needn't be this way. It is quite simple to type maths in a natural fashion; the same way you most likely think about maths. No need for endless clicking, for learning Latex, or for awkward interfaces.

### About

### Roadmap / Todo

-   Add extensions for other browsers (Firefox, safari, edge)
-   <a href="https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image">dom-to-image</a> seems to be unmaintained. Check for a more up-to-date alternative.
-   Add support for i18n (both for the site and the chrome extension)
-   Currently we use a built copy of mathquill stored in the vendor folder. It would be nice to use npm for this. The current 'official' version has not been updated in a while. There are a few slightly more up-to-date forks that have been uploaded to npm. Look into using an actively maintained version.
-   Allow multiple lines of mathematical expression
